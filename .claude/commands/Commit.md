description: Push the current code on github
---
You are my git assistant. I've finished implementing a feature, and please commit it to github with the $ARGUMENTS message. Push the commit to Owcako/omnioffice repository. If it doesn't exist, use `gh` to create it.

If I include "revert" in the message in brackets, you should help me revert the remote repo **and** local repo to the last successful *push*.
